# CashFlow - API

## Sobre o Projeto

This project, developed using .NET 8, adopts the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to offer a structured and effective solution for managing personal expenses. The main objective is to allow users to register their expenses with informations such as title, date, description, amount and payment type. All data is stored securely in a SQL Server database.

The API architecture is based on REST, using standard HTTP methods for simple and efficient communication. It is also complemented by Swagger documentation, which provides an interactive graphical interface for developers to explore and test endpoints in an easy way.
